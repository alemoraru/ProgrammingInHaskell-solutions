# Programming In Haskell, 2nd Edition

This repository contains my solutions to Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell (2nd Edition) book.

**NOTES**:
* Solutions were checked manually in ghci, but not via property based testing
* Some exercises might me missing in some chapters
* I am using this repository to document my intro to Haskell programming, therefore it is entirely possible that I did not adhere to some Haskell programming conventions
